### Problem Statement: :thinking:    
In a smart city, community service is an opportunity for the people to contribute towards the betterment and development of the city as well as in helping to maintain the status of a smart city. But there isn’t any proper platform where people can find those opportunities or post any requirement whether personal or organisational. Many times local people are unable to find help and volunteers for community services. Due to COVID-19 many people are in dire need of help and there are many kind souls that want to help them but don’t have any platform to collaborate. Our aim is to provide such people a platform where they can connect with other people and find help free of cost and do their part of being a better citizen by helping others in organising cleanup drives, donation drives, hunger relief drives, shifting, blood donation, helping senior citizens, doing taxes, teaching, coaching, sport events, animal adoption, COVID-19 supplies distribution, plasma donation, helping NGOs, tech support etc. We also aim to acknowledge people’s work by providing certificates to them as a token of appreciation.

### Solution Overview::right_anger_bubble:
1. Our platform will provide one stop solution to all the volunteer needs. We intend to provide a space for people to find people who are passionate about and committed to their cause, and who can help when and where they need them. Since a lot of places are cutting costs and with many people in need, this is one step to build a kinder community. Our solution would have a positive impact on people who are in need but cannot afford to pay for help. 
2. We intend to make a website using `HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, MYSQL`. Our database implemented using MySql and PHP would provide a seamless experience to users. Our website would be optimized for different screen sizes making it adaptable to different resolutions. 
3. One constraint would be the reliability and credibility of people who volunteer or of the people who post requirements.

### Impact: :scroll:    
Helps to develop an increased sense of social responsibility- a global view of society and a heart of ‘giving back’ and helping others. Provides an opportunity to the youngsters to build their network while helping people in need.

### Future Scope: 	:crystal_ball:     
A community building exercise will improve public relations and promote unity. Future plans might include working with schools, colleges, NGOs and also the government towards a better society and raising responsible adults.
